          <h1>Ever wondered what it might be like to have a conversation with a lamp post, letterbox or building? </h1>
          <p>Hello Lamp Post is waking up for the first time in London in and around Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. With a range of street objects and buildings waking up and talking, Hello Lamp Post encourages you to look at the area in which you live, work or play with fresh eyes and engage with objects you might sometimes take for granted. Why not tell the London Aquatics Centre about the amazing view, or tell the bench you’re sitting on about your day? Hello Lamp Post has already seen success in Singapore, Austin and Bristol.</p>

          <h1>More Information</h1>
          <p>If you look closely, most street objects have a manufacturer or maintenance reference code on them. These codes are used by operators to distinguish one object from another. Hello Lamp Post gives a new use to these existing codes by allowing localised conversations in public spaces.</p>
          <p>You can have a chat with any object- post boxes, bollards, bus stops, boats, utility boxes, bridges, telegraph poles - and of course lamp posts themselves! What’s more, for the first time ever, you’ll also be able to speak to the iconic buildings and features of the Park- including the London Stadium, Lee Valley VeloPark, the London Aquatics Centre and the Olympic Rings.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-6 pushed-column">
          <p>The interaction takes the form of a conversation. The objects are curious about the world they find themselves in and want to ask you questions about it. The response they receive are then shared with other players meaning an object understands the personality and people of the local area.</p>
          <p>Conversations can be started from any mobile phone that sends text (SMS) messages. It’s free to play (standard SMS and data rates apply) and it’s suitable for all ages.</p>
          <p class="small">Please note, as Hello Lamp Post is geared towards sharing thoughts and opinions within a fun conversation, the objects themselves won’t give operational information such as opening times and ticket prices.</p>
